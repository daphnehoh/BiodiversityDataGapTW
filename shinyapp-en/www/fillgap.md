## Let's fill the gap!

This page presents the spatial data gaps and their prioritized categories recommended for filling.<br>

- TBIA has nearly 20 million records within the Taiwan's land and maritime boundaries. Assuming these records are evenly distributed across Taiwan's 5x5 km grid, each grid should have at least 3,000 records. Therefore, we identified grids with fewer than 3,000 records and those with no records as recommended priority grids for filling, marking them as spatial data gaps.<br>

- We have organized the spatial data gaps and their prioritized categories into a downloadable [CSV](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=14sY5IwoVrj_hmVsYrxIyV50zYm2b4b2j).<br>

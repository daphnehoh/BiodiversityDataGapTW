## Spatial data overview

This page allows us to examine the record distribution within 5x5 km spatial grids. Areas without grids indicate no records for those regions. You can filter by taxon groups of interest. If you wish to search for a single species, please visit the [TBIA](https://tbiadata.tw) portal.

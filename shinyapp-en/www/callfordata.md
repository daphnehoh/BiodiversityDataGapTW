**Call for Taiwan Biodiversity Data**<br>

According to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility [GBIF](gbif.org), Taiwan currently ranks second in Asia in terms of the number of open biodiversity data, after India. However, when looking at the species diversity covered by the data, Taiwan's performance is even better. <br>

In order to make Taiwan's biodiversity open data more comprehensive and facilitate future application development, we first seek for data on the following areas:<br>

1. Environment: **Records of marine environment occurrences**. Taiwan is surrounded by sea, and this data will aid in marine conservation and sustainable use! <br>
2. Data type: **DNA and eDNA derived occurrence records**. Molecular techniques have significantly improved biodiversity surveys. These data can supplement traditional morphological identification and uncover hidden biodiversity. <br>
3. Species groups: **Bacteria, Archaea, Fungi and Lichens, Protists, Prototheca, Insects, Molluscs**. While large animals dominate the current database, these smaller organisms are crucial for understanding ecosystem structure and function. <br>

To encourage data sharing, we offer professional services for data integration, cleaning, formatting, and publishing. If you are willing to share your data, our team will assist you through the entire process. Together, let's create a new chapter in Taiwanâ€™s biodiversity open data!<br>

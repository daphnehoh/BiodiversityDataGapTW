### Taxon tree and record gap

This page presents the species recorded in TaiCOL in the form of a species tree. The starting node of the tree represents the major taxonomic groups we have previously classified, with subsequent nodes representing families, genera, and scientific names.<br>

If a species had been recorded in TBIA, **[Recorded]** will be displayed next to its scientific name.<br>
